Purpose
A document with the correct procedures on modification/interesterification (RX) start up.
Scope
This document will be used as a reference when operators are unfamiliar with the procedures pertaining to RX operating and start-up.
This document pertains to RxA equipment.

Procedure
1.	Start the vacuum system.
1.1.	All vacuum system valves should be in automatic mode on the Dry RX screen. (appendix a.)
1.2.	Open Process Control Screen (appendix b.) and press Start Vacuum. 
1.3.	Full vacuum is less than 30 mm.	
2.	When full vacuum is obtained prepare to fill mod vessel.
2.1.	Before starting to line up transfer from Hydro tank farm to RX vessel, make sure that piping is not being used for other transfers or plant operations.
2.2.	Starting at the assigned feed supply tank, line up the pipe and valves from 		Hydro Plant to RX vessel.
2.3.	After lineup is completed, blow transfer line with nitrogen to make sure 			there are no plugs or frozen lines. 
3.	On screen Dry RX screen set the following.
3.1.	Ensure feed supply pump, P-803, is in auto.
3.2.	Open the Process Control Screen and enter the fill level set-point for RX vessel. Standard batch size is 35,000 lbs. unless otherwise noted on ITS batch log.
3.3.	Set the oil feed temperature controller, TIC-731 to Temperature set point of 190F. Consult the “Feed Temperatures for Specific Products” document for Temperature set points variances for specific products. Note: Once the reactor is “Filled” it automatically proceeds to the “Drying” step. 
3.4.	Drying Time is 10 minutes.
4.	Ensure the following selector switches are in Auto on Dry RX screen:
4.1.	Agitator A-730. Agitator A-900.
4.2.	Ensure all COV’s in auto. (except COV-730D)
4.3.	Feed Pump, P-803. Transfer pump, P-743.
4.4.	Open the discharge valve at the bottom of the assigned feed supply tank. 

Refer to the video "RxA_UserManual_Video1.mp4" for startup process details.

5.	Filling the RX vessel with product oil.

5.1.	To start the filling of the RX vessel, press the “Start Batch” button on Process Control screen. The following will occur automatically:
5.1.1.	Oil inlet valve to reactor COV-730 C will open.
5.1.2.	Feed pump P-803 will start.
5.1.3.	Temperature controller TIC-731 will open and start controlling.
5.1.4.	Oil is now flowing into the RX vessel. 
5.1.5.	When the oil level in RX vessel reaches 20% the agitator A-730 will start.
5.2.	With the agitator on, the oil will be re-circulated to promote the drying process. Line up the RX transfer pump, P-743, for re-circulation of oil in   RX vessel. Open the manual recycle valve. (add valve tag #)
5.3.	RX transfer pump, P-743 will automatically start at the beginning of the drying step. Once pressure is sensed the pump will remain on until no discharge pressure is sensed.
5.4.	If temperature set point is not reached, open steam to the steam coil and heat the oil up to 190 F for complete drying. Note: watch the oil temperature closely so you do not overheat oil. Steam valve is a manual operation.
5.5.	The RX vessel will continue to fill until the level reaches preset as measured by LT -730 and FQT-5503. 
6.	When the preset level is reached the following will occur. 
6.1.	Alarm will sound.   
6.2.	Reactor full will appear on screen.
6.3.	Feed pump P-803 will stop.
6.4.	Feed valve COV-730 C will close.
6.5.	Temperature controller TIC-731 will now switch to manual with o% output.
7.	Blowing lines to RX vessel after filling is completed.
7.1.	Close discharge valve on source tank.
7.2.	Open up nitrogen blow line close to source tank.
7.3.	Put feed pump P-803 in manual mode and restart.
7.4.	Open feed valve COV-730 C using manual selector switch.
7.5.	Allow line to blow for 2 minutes. Close COV-730 C to build up nitrogen pressure.  After one-minute, open COV-730 C and allow blowing for two minutes again. Repeat this blowing procedure two more times to insure total clearing of transfer line.   	
8.	Oil Drying
8.1.	Prior to the catalyst addition, the oil must be maintained above the preset “Drying Temperature” as measured by TT-730 and below 30 mm vacuum as measured by PT-730, for the set amount of “Drying Time” to insure complete moisture removal.  
8.2.	At the end of the “Drying Time” an alarm will sound notifying the operator that the oil is dry and to start reaction.
8.3.	Take sample to the lab for FFA & moisture levels. The analytical “Karl Fisher” method must be used, “sizzle test” performed on hot plate is not an acceptable test. If moisture is above 100 ppm, continue drying for additional 10 minutes then re-sample.  
8.4.	Once moisture quality is below 100 ppm, prepare for catalyst addition.	
9.	Catalyst Addition
9.1.	Using the vacuum wand and hose, suck in a weighed volume of catalyst 22 lbs. into the RX vessel. See Appendix for Sodium methylate addition procedure.
9.2.	Once catalyst has been added, confirm the addition by proceeding to “React Batch” step on Process control screen.
9.3.	The reaction timer (20 minutes) will then begin. 
9.4.	At the end of the preset reaction time, an alarm will sound signaling the operator to sample reactor for melt point and IV test. “Sample Rx” will appear on screen. Once the reaction end point is confirmed, prepare to proceed to Citric Addition Step.
9.5.	If reaction end point is not met, consult working foreperson or supervisor.  If not able to consult, see table 2 for troubleshooting guidance.

10.	Neutralization (Neutralization procedure for RxA)

10.1.	Proceed to the “Add citric acid” step on the Process control screen.
10.2.	Using the vacuum wand and hose, pull in 28 gallons of 25% citric solution.
10.3.	With the MOD agitator on leave to mix for 10 minutes.
10.4.	After 10 minutes sample to check soap level/ppm.
10.5.	If the test results are 0 ppm, keep going with the process.
10.6.	If 0 soap is not met, consult working foreperson or supervisor. If not able to consult, see table 3 for troubleshooting guidance.

11.	Fill Precoat and Process Aid addition 
11.1.	Proceed to the “Fill Precoat Tank” step on the Process control screen. The following will occur:
11.2.	COV 940 and COV 949 will open and the precoat tank will begin to fill.      
11.3.	With the tank ¾ full add the following:
11.4.	If new filter, add 100 lbs. of filter aid (DE). If not, do not add.
11.5.	50 lbs. of Sorbsil (Silicate) 
11.6.	100 lbs. of bleaching clay.
11.7.	Once high level in pre-coat is reached, COV-940 and COV-949 will close. 	
11.8.	Let it mix for 10 minutes in Pre-coat tank.
11.9.	While mixing, proceed to RX Vessel transfer to Drop Tank.

12.	RX Vessel transfer to Drop Tank
12.1.	Proceed to the “Transfer to Drop Tank” step on the Process control screen. The following will occur:
12.2.	COV 941 and COV 943 will open and the Drop Tank will begin to fill.
12.3.	The manual recycle valve on the RX Vessel must be closed at this time. 
12.4.	RX transfer pump, P-743 will remain on until no discharge pressure is sensed utilizing PS-743. COV-941 will then close.
13.	Transfer Precoat to Drop Tank 
13.1.	Once the drop tank has been filled proceed to the “Transfer Precoat w/ Clay & DE” step on the Process Control Screen. The following will occur:
13.2.	COV 930 and COV 946 will open. Precoat pump, PU930 will start. The Precoat tank contents will be transferred to the Drop Tank.
13.3.	PU 930 will turn off automatically when 0% is reached in the Precoat tank.
13.4.	Proceed to “Purge Precoat Line”, COV 930 will close and COV 931 will activate.
13.5.	After purge is completed, allow for 10 min mix time in the Drop Tank, then prepare for filtering.

14.	Prepare oil for filtering:
14.1.	The operator should now line up all the filter valves for recycle back to drop tank.
14.2.	Make sure filter feed pump, P-910, and filtrate pump, P-740, are in “Auto”.
15.	Start filtering:
15.1.	On Process Control, proceed to “Recycle for Clarity” 
15.2.	Filter feed pump, P-910 and Filtrate pump, P-740, will start. P-910 should run at a min speed of 24 Hz.
15.3.	Recycle for 20 min.
15.4.	Take filtrate sample to lab. Check for soap, clarity, and color.  
15.5.	If all in spec, set up line to destination tank and proceed to “Filter Batch” step on Process Control Screen.
15.6.	If filtration quality is not met, consult working foreperson or supervisor. If not able to consult, see table 4 for troubleshooting guidance.
15.7.	The reactor level, LT-900 will decrease as the oil is sent to storage. When the level of the reactor falls below 10%, the pressure transmitter, PT -711 is      monitored for a loss of pressure signaling the reactor is empty. Once the pressure drops the following will occur. 
15.8.	Filter feed pump P-910 and Filtrate pump P-740 will shut off. COV-902 will close.
16.	Blowing Filter Line and Press 
16.1.	When Drop Tank is empty, put filter feed pump P-910 and filtrate pump P-740 on manual and re-start both pumps.
16.2.	Close suction valve at bottom of drop tank. Open nitrogen blow line and blow through filter feed pump P-910 all the way through the filter press.
16.3.	Note, blow gently so you do not over fill press trough or create dirty oil.
16.4.	When all oil has been blown from filter press, shut off filter feed pump P-910, shut off blow line and close valves.
16.5.	Blow line from filtrate pump P-740 to the selected receiving tank and shut off pump.
17.	Kettle transfer to storage tank
