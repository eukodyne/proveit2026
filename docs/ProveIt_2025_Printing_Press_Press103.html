12. Troubleshooting

Operating the Comexi F2 ML flexographic printing press requires vigilance to maintain print quality and minimize downtime. Below is a guide to common printing issues, their potential causes, and recommended solutions:

12.1. Bleeding/Smudging

Appearance: The terms bleeding or smudging are used in situations when colored constituents of the printing ink become visible in parts of the motif which have not been printed. (The previous ink must be dry enough to be able to absorb the ink that is to be applied subsequently.)

Image Example:

Refer to image "ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_BleedingSmudging.png" to see an example of bleeding/smudging.
<img src="ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_BleedingSmudging.png"/>

Causes and Remedies:

[
  {
    "cause": "Ink drying too slowly.",
    "remedy": "Increase drying temperature or air flow to accelerate ink drying."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Excessive ink application.",
    "remedy": "Reduce ink film thickness by adjusting anilox roller or ink formulation."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Incompatible ink and substrate.",
    "remedy": "Ensure ink is suitable for the substrate being used."
  },
  {
    "cause": "High ambient humidity.",
    "remedy": "Control environmental conditions to maintain optimal humidity levels."
  }
]

12.2 Troubleshooting - Bridging

Appearance: Bridging occurs when adjacent design elements unintentionally connect due to ink spread, leading to a loss of detail and clarity in the printed image.

Image Example:

Refer to image "ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Bridging.png" to see an example of dot gain.
<img src="ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Bridging.png"/>

Causes and Remedies:
[
  {
    "cause": "The relative humidity is too high. Water is condensing into the solvent-based inks.",
    "remedy": "Replace with fresh ink. Adjust the solvent mixture. Increase the performance of the dryer between the printing units."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The ink recipe is not suitable for the printed motif.",
    "remedy": "Replace the ink."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Incorrect selection of the solvent. The ink dries too quickly.",
    "remedy": "Empty the ink tank and adjust the solvent mixture."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The ink viscosity is too high.",
    "remedy": "Reduce the viscosity."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The transferred volume is too high.",
    "remedy": "For the print job, select anilox rollers with a lower transferred volume."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The anilox roller and width of the printing plate raster do not match.",
    "remedy": "Use a finer anilox roller."
  }
]


12.3 Troubleshooting - Blocking 

Appearance: The ink adheres to the reverse side of the film and causes damage when the substrate is unrolled.

Image Example:

Refer to image "ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Blocking.png" to see an example of dot gain.
<img src="ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Blocking.png"/>

Causes and Remedies:
[
  {
    "cause": "There is too much retarder in the ink.",
    "remedy": "Replace the ink."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The film temperature at the winder is too high.",
    "remedy": "Reduce the temperature of the tunnel dryer and check whether the cooling drum is working."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The pretreatment level of the film is too low.",
    "remedy": "Check the pretreatment and the age of the film. Use the inline corona treatment."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Ink drying is too slow.",
    "remedy": "Increase the performance of the dryer. Use a faster drying solvent. Reduce the printing speed."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The ink volume transferred is too high.",
    "remedy": "Select anilox rollers with a lower transferred volume."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The ink viscosity is too high.",
    "remedy": "Reduce the ink viscosity by adding solvents."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The cooling is not working.",
    "remedy": "Please contact the service department."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Excessive winding pressure at the winder.",
    "remedy": "Reduce the winding pressure."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The moisture of the wound web is too high.",
    "remedy": "Increase the performance of the dryer between the printing mechanisms and reduce the cooling."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Coating or pretreatment on both sides of the film.",
    "remedy": "Check whether the correct ink system is being used."
  }
]


12.4. Troubleshooting - Dot Gain

Appearance: Dots are larger than expected – usual phenomenon observed in flexography which reduces the details and the contrast.

Image Example:

Refer to image "ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_DotGainTooHigh.png" to see an example of dot gain.
<img src="ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_DotGainTooHigh.png"/>

Video Example:

<video src="video/ProveIt/Press103/ProveIt_Troubleshooting_DotGain.mp4"></video>

Causes and Remedies:

[
  {
    "cause": "Excessive printing pressure.",
    "remedy": "Adjust to a 'kiss' impression by reducing printing pressure."
  },
  {
    "cause": "High ink viscosity.",
    "remedy": "Ensure ink viscosity aligns with manufacturer recommendations."
  },
  {
    "cause": "Inappropriate anilox roll specifications.",
    "remedy": "Select an anilox roll with suitable cell volume and line screen for the job."
  }
]

12.5. Troubleshooting - Misregistration (Inaccurate Register)

Appearance: Misalignment of colors or design elements during printing, leading to blurred or overlapping images.

Image Example:
Refer to image "ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Register.png" to see an example of dot gain.
<img src="ProveIt/Press103/Press103_Troubleshooting_Register.png"/>

Causes and Remedies:

[
  {
    "cause": "There is a difference in the speed between the plate and impression cylinder.",
    "remedy": "Check the speed settings of the plate and impression cylinder to ensure they are synchronized."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The printing plate is not mounted correctly.",
    "remedy": "Verify that the printing plate is mounted accurately and securely."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The substrate is stretching or contracting during printing.",
    "remedy": "Ensure consistent web tension and consider using substrates with stable dimensional properties."
  },
  {
    "cause": "The substrate reel is defective.",
    "remedy": "Replace the reel of the substrate to ensure material integrity."
  }
]
